  Let me start by introducing myself, I'm Tom a recent graduate of a coding bootcamp. I went to Le Wagon in Rio de Janeiro to learn how to code, giving up my cushy quality assurance job working for a major petrochemical company. This was one of the most terryfing decisions I have ever made, but it has been one of the best in my life. There is nothing in my life that has giving me the joy (besides my family) that coding does. It provides a nice challenge and it constantly requires you to continue learning.

  I am currently location independent and flexible to go anywhere for work. At the moment I am located in the Charlotte, NC area. If you want to learn more about my previous careers you can check out my <strong><%= link_to 'résumé', 'images/resume.pdf', target: '_blank' %></strong> which will show you the very untraditional path that I have taken to get to this point in my life.

  Currently I am working on a project for a non profit to redo there website aswell as touts.com.br completing maintenance and upgrades. I have also been studying React and Redux when I have the free time.
